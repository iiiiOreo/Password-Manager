# Password-Manager
## Introduction
The project aims to provide a secure and convenient way to store and access passwords for 
various online accounts. The project has three main features: 
- Password generator: This feature allows the user to create strong and random passwords for 
different websites or applications. 
- Password checker: This feature allows the user to check the strength and security of their 
existing passwords. The user can enter their passwords and get feedback on how easy or hard 
they are to crack by hackers. 
- Password saver and retriever: This feature allows the user to save and retrieve their passwords in 
an encrypted form. The passwords are encrypted using AES encryption, which is a standard and 
widely used algorithm for data protection. The passwords are stored on a cloud server. To 
access the saved passwords, the user must bypass two factor authentication using Google 
Authenticator, a mobile app that generates a one-time code for verification
